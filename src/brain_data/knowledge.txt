V-List is an AI-powered lead generation platform.
It uses generic scraping and n8n workflows to find potential clients.
The system stores leads in a PostgreSQL database.
AI Agents (Jules, Researcher) process these leads to qualify them.
The GTM Engine is the infrastructure powering V-List.
It includes components like Ollama (Local Brain), Qdrant (Vector Memory), and Streamlit (Mission Control).
